<h1> D3 graphs! </h1>

<h3>Random assortment of interesting and cool D3 charts I have found on blocks. </h3>

<h3>Because of CORS, whenever you need to read a CSV file and such do the following (This also requires Node to be installed globally on your computer):

  <ul>
    <li>npm install -g http-server </li>
    <li>From terminal, cd into the folder </li>
    <li>http-server -c-1</li>
  </ul>

Otherwise you can just open the file. If that fails, just do the above for any graph; it could be because I am using Allow-Cross-Origin extension in Chrome.
